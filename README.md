An automation framework written in C# on top of Selenium and Appium and using NUnit. This framework provides an easy to use API for writing page objects and UI tests for your websites, mobile sites and native iOS and Android applications. It provides services like driver management, session handling, config handling, logging and also provides an easy way to read and write test data into dedicated config files.

# Credits
I have to give credit to the developers who taught me and helped me write better code and improve the framework at every step of the way. Thanks guys for spending your time with me for either long review sessions or long discussions even though you knew it may not benefit you directly / immediately / at all.
